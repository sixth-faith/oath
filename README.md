for those software developers who believes that is is the human who creates both — the idea and the technology

We all have ideas. The implemented ideas transformed into technologies.  
Our community believes that is is the human who creates both — the idea and the technology.

The observation and analysis of repetitive patterns can be structured and turned into the system, which can become the technology or even new global standard, which eventually saves time for people.

As committed information technology community representatives over the years, we have observed different strategies in Information Technology world.

We believe that our IT community should protect, support, not harm and evolve the humankind transforming ideas we have into technologies to save time of our lives.

If you would like to join our community and agree, please commit the code, solution to some specific task.
